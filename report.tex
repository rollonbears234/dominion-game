\section{Dominion}

You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens.
Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams!
You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees.
You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums.
All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy.
You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner.
